      <p>Development-oriented, service-minded master degree holder in Computer Application and my education has been recognized in Denmark as Cand .it.</p>
      <p>My master’s degree in Computer Application has enabled me with solid technical knowledge. My work experience within web and software development
      in a number of positions has enriched me with sound work experience and knowledge. I have developed in C#, PHP and React. Apart from work
        experience, I have been also doing personal projects as the web development is what I am passionate about. </p>
      <p>Life as a woman who moved from India to Denmark and a mother of two young children has demanded me a number of sacrifices in my career.
         I did it happily. Time has come to me to concentrate on my career. </p>
      <p>My adventurous journey to Denmark as an immigrant has bestowed upon me life experience and skills which have strengthened my “YES I CAN”
        attitude.</p>
      <p>Along with these professional, work-related and personal skills, I am on the lookout for a job opportunity within web development and
        software development.</p>
